<h3 id="lendmark-loans">Lendmark Loans</h3>
<p><strong>Lendmark Money Services</strong> is a company that gives out auto loans and short term loans (i.e. payday loans). They have an office in Anaheim and an office in Long Beach. </p>
<p>When I was buying the Range Rover, they handed me a $16,383.00 check to give to the dealership for the Range Rover. I had no ID. </p>
<p>This prompted me to try to apply for loans from them in other names and just going to a different branch than the Long Beach one, and applying for loans that aren&#39;t necessarily auto loans. </p>
<p>So I applied for a loan in a Rina something name, some girl who has an 820. They sent me this email-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Congratulations, one step closer to receiving  your loan today!
Dear MARIA REYNA,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for making Lendmark Financial Services your Lender of Choice.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve spoken to them over the phone and just said that I was Reyna&#39;s husband and that she gave them my phone number just to make sure the application process was completed. All they requested was for Reyna to upload a picture of her drivers license and a paystub. Those two things are <strong>butter</strong>, and this is for a $2500 loan. <strong>the catch</strong> is that I don&#39;t have black ink for my printer or a girl to act as Reyna. </p>
<p>We could always do a different application in Manuel&#39;s name or something for a different loan in which I could go in for, but regardless, we&#39;ll need ink. </p>

<p>Self-explanitory, we just need cards really</p>
<h2 id="merchant-services">Merchant services</h2>
<p>I recently applied for a few merchant accounts with a couple of different providers, one of them- <strong>PaymentCloud</strong> in whom I specified I needed to be able to process cards over the phone immediately, sent me this email today - </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good afternoon Rina,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I just wanted to follow up with you to see if you had any questions about my prequalification form, my requirements for underwriting, or the underwriting process in general.  I&#39;m always happy to help.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Best,
Phil</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much like the loan issue, I need ink to complete this application because I have to make her an ID. BTW, Rina and Reyna are two different people. Weird coincidence, I know. </p>
<p>What having a merchant account would allow us to do is cash out credit and debit cards instantly, by processing our own orders over the phone and/or web. </p>
<p>Phone evades all of the anti-fraud/money laundering technologies that exist on the web that we sometimes overlook. It&#39;s really lucriative. </p>
<p><strong>What criminal uses the phone to launder money?</strong></p>
<p>a confident one, and you wont find confident criminals very frequently, fortunately I was blessed with the gift of gab and/or narcisstic personality traits so I have no issue using the phone whilst commiting crime.</p>
<h2 id="lendtek">LendTek</h2>
<p>Lendtek is a company offering small business loans in whom I&#39;ve sucessfully got funded from back in September of last year. It was my first time messing with business bank statements and the statements I sent them were <strong>fucking terrible</strong>. For example -- </p>
<p><a href="https://i.ibb.co/Z28vWQn/god-awful.png">Click</a></p>
<p>This was one of the statements I sent in, where the BoA logo was mismatching the timeframe (BoAs logo has changed a lot since then), charcters are off and things are mispelled and the formats are off, but they didn&#39;t care about any of it. The numbers were <strong>adequate</strong> so they were satisifed, and they wired $12,500 to me within a few days. </p>
<p>As long as you can charm your way into the hearts of the underwriters, you&#39;re honestly good the majority of the time. I&#39;ve had business funding companies not want to deal with me at all though, and it was always when I talked to the U/W before the loan officers. The loan officers are like the car salesman of the funding industry, whereas the U/W are the finance managers that you meet with to sign the papers. </p>
<p>I have business fullz that I can use with Lendtek right now, and I have legitimate business bank statements that I&#39;d just need to change the name and date on, I just haven&#39;t had the drive to embark on a Lendtek lick lately, but last time that I checked it was still completely practical. </p>
<h2 id="dreamspring">DreamSpring</h2>
<p>These people want to give me $50,000.00 so bad and I&#39;m making it so difficult for them. I don&#39;t want to submit lackluster tax documents so I&#39;ve been avoiding my loan officer all together. I still have him on the hook but I need to submit an individual tax form for Manuel, and a annual profit and loss for last year for CAFE VIDTIA. I don&#39;t want to make them, I&#39;d rather just buy them so I don&#39;t have to worry about the ambiguity of doing it sufficiently or the feelings of inevitable inadequacy if they aren&#39;t sufficient and it gets rejected. </p>
