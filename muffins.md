You mentioned that in your free time *all you do is think about ways to make money*, which, *if* this is the case, you're in luck. 

I have so many different ideas of ways to make money that have actual realistic chances of working, and I have documentation and things to back what I'm proposing and, if you feel interested, can pursue them with me. 

#### PoS Malware (i.e. PoSeidon)

Lately PoS systems have been getting stolen by people we associate with (i.e. smoke) to the point where they're suggesting that they are even easy to take.

The way Smoke and anybody else in our small coveted drug-induced half-ass fraud scene is approaching PoS systems however is all wrong. 

There have been PoS malware strains that have been spotted in the wild for years, i.e. [PoSeidon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PoSeidon_(malware))

Instead of tendering actual transactions and jeapordizing your OPSEC and killing the cards in *real time* you can drop a shred of PoS malware on it and scrape the entire flash memory for any luhn algorithm-matching sequences of numbers. Once you've obtained the credit card numbers, you can then decide to either sell them for $25 a piece to a marketplace on the clearnet or use them yourself. 

**either way you're cashing out** 

the hard part for *you and I* is obtaining the actual PoS device.
